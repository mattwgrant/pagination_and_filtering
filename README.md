This project, while still functioning without JavaScript, demonstrates pagination.

This is done using a function to determine what will show up on the page and another to create links based upon
how many sets of pages will be needed.

This project uses for loops, functions, conditionals, and DOM mainpulation through cereating and appending elements.

At the end, you are left with a list of any length that will be displayed in groups of 10, with links generated
based off of the number of groups needed to display all students.
